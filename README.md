# Welcome to OMG, Shoes...

OMG, Shoes... is a community for sneaker enthusiasts to keep track of their
sneaker collection and view and discuss collections with other users.

# Technical

This version of OMG, Shoes... is a C#/.NET api version of my Nashville Software
School front end, JSON server, [capstone project](https://github.com/ericlheidel/omg-shoes). The front end is
written in Reactjs, the back end is written in C#/.NET, and the database is
through PostgreSQL16.

Having written this project's front end in Reactjs, it currently acts as an SPA
(Single Page Application). I am currently working on a Next.js version of this
project that I will also deploy, in hopes to showcase my React growth into non-SPA's.

# Deployment

This was my first real-deal deployment and I worked through it by myself, failing,
triumphing, and failing again. After enough trial and error, researching, and reading docs,
I accomplished my goal. I feel confident in my ability to complete this process.

I decided to dive into learning how to deploy and host my own domain and projects myself.
I landed on using a DigitalOcean Droplet running Ubuntu 24.04.
- Frontend Deployment
  - The Reactjs portion of the project was built with `npm`
  - `Nginx 1.24.0` is being used as a reverse proxy, is serving the files,
   and is routing the API requests.
- Backend Deployment
  - `dotnet` to build and publish the API.
  - `dotnet efcore` for Migrations.
  - `systemd` manages the API lifecycle.
- Database
  - `postgresql@16` is running a dedicated cluster for the database.
- SSL/TLS Configuration
  - `certbot` created my `.pem` files for certification
  - `letsencrypt` to secure my frontend and backend endpoints
  - `nginx` to configure my project to use `HTTPS`
